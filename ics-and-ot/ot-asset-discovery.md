# OT Asset Discovery

## What is Asset Discovery?

Asset discovery and inventory in operational technology (OT) environments refer to the systematic identification, classification, and documentation of all devices and systems connected to an industrial network. This process is crucial for understanding the landscape of OT assets, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and sensors.

Asset discovery is essential for maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the network topology, potential vulnerabilities, and ensuring efficient cybersecurity practices. In compliance with legislation and regulations, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and industry-specific standards like IEC 62443, organisations are required to conduct regular asset inventories to enhance security and resilience against cyber threats in OT environments.

An asset inventory typically includes, but not limited to;&#x20;

* Asset ID
* Asset Type: PLC, HMI etc
* Manufacturer
* IP Address
* MAC Address
* Firmware Version
* Operating System and Version
* Installed Applications and Versions
* Ports

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of this information may already exist in paper files, spreadsheets, or IT management databases, however in most cases, existing OT asset information is out-of-date and incomplete.
{% endhint %}

To create an asset inventory, you must be able to detect devices communicating over the OT network, as well as those that may not communicate often or at all, however are still attached to the network. There are many ways to do this, and will depend on the type of environment you are working with. This document will aim to outline the procedures.&#x20;
